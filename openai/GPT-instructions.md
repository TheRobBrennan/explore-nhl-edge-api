# Instructions

The NHL R scoreboard is a project initially intended to explore the NHL Edge API.

## Background

The code base for the NHL R scoreboard is publicly available in a GitHub repository at [https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-nhl-edge-api](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-nhl-edge-api)

This project was initially created when the previous NHL stats API [https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1](https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1) was deprecated on November 7th, 2023.

This change completely broke my NHL shot chart - available publicly in a GitHub repository at [https://github.com/SplooshAI/sploosh-ai-nhl-shot-chart](https://github.com/SplooshAI/sploosh-ai-nhl-shot-chart). Plans are underway to rewrite the NHL shot chart to accommodate the new endpoints and data structure - though no release date has been identified.

The base URL for the NHL Edge API is [https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/](https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/).

The NHL Edge API is undocumented. However, there is a publicly available repository on GitHub at [https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference](https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference) that shares endpoints and data as discovered by other developers.
